JumpCloudQA

QA Assignment:
For this assignment, JumpCloud has implemented a password hashing application in Golang
and we have intentionally left bugs in it. The assignment is to write the test cases needed to
test the application, explain your choices for coverage, execute the test cases and report the
bugs you find. Deliverables should be submitted along with a README in a GitHub repo that
you share with us.
The style, depth, scope and type of tests and bug reports you write are up to you. Use them to
demonstrate your style and strengths.
Obtaining the Password Hashing Application
We are storing the password hashing application in a public S3 bucket. You can get it in the
following manner:
Linux example:

$ wget --no-check-certificate --no-proxy
‘https://s3.amazonaws.com/qa-broken-hashserve/broken-hashserve.tgz’
Windows example:
On modern Windows systems with PowerShell 3.x, curl/wget/iwr are just aliases for
Invoke-WebRequest. It has equivalent curl/wget/iwr parameters and output; they are just
named different things. On Windows 10, you will also need to install 7zip or equivalent
extraction tool to unpack the *.tgz archive.
C:/> iwr -Uri
https://s3.amazonaws.com/qa-broken-hashserve/broken-hashserve.tgz
-UseBasicParsing -o ./broken-hashserve.tgz
Password Hashing Application Execution
The broken-hashserve.tgz archive contains binaries for Linux, Windows & Mac OS X
operating systems. Unpack and use the binary corresponding to your OS of choice. We are
certain that the application will not run amok and trash your workstation/laptop; that being said,
you should always run untrusted binaries in a virtual environment for a number of reasons :)
You must set a PORT environment variable before executing the application. It will crash
otherwise.
Linux example:
$ export PORT=8088
Windows example:
1. C:/> SET PORT=8088
2. Use the Control Panel to set a System or User variable for
PORT. Remember to reopen your cmd window after doing this.
We tested the password hashing application on the following operating systems:
● Ubuntu 16.04
● Mac OS X - Sierra, High Sierra
● Windows 10
Password Hashing Application Specification
The following is the requirement specification that was used in building the password hashing
application. It describes what the application should do.
● When launched, the application should wait for http connections.
● It should answer on the PORT specified in the PORT environment variable.
● It should support three endpoints:
○ A POST to /hash should accept a password. It should return a job identifier
immediately. It should then wait 5 seconds and compute the password hash.
The hashing algorithm should be SHA512.
○ A GET to /hash should accept a job identifier. It should return the base64
encoded password hash for the corresponding POST request.
○ A GET to /stats should accept no data. It should return a JSON data structure
for the total hash requests since the server started and the average time of a
hash request in milliseconds.
● The software should be able to process multiple connections simultaneously.
● The software should support a graceful shutdown request. Meaning, it should allow any
in-flight password hashing to complete, reject any new requests, respond with a 200 and
shutdown.
● No additional password requests should be allowed when shutdown is pending.
Interacting with the Password Hashing Application
You can interact/test the application using curl. The following are examples that would/should
generate similar returns - the job identifier does not need to conform to a specification.
● Post to the /hash endpoint
$ curl -X POST -H "application/json" -d '{"password":"angrymonkey"}'
http://127.0.0.1:8088/hash
> 42
● Get the base64 encoded password
$ curl -H "application/json" http://127.0.0.1:8088/hash/1
> zHkbvZDdwYYiDnwtDdv/FIWvcy1sKCb7qi7Nu8Q8Cd/MqjQeyCI0pWKDGp74A1g==
● Get the stats
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8088/stats
> {"TotalRequests":3,"AverageTime":5004625}
● Shutdown
$ curl -X POST -d ‘shutdown’ http://127.0.0.1:8088/hash
> 200 Empty Response
